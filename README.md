### GROVER'S ALGORITHM
This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of Grover's algorithm, a quantum search algorithm, in a unstructured database setting. Grover's algorithm offers a quadratic speedup compared to classical search algorithms, making it an intriguing approach for efficient searching in large databases.
### COMPLEXITY
In classical search algorithms, the complexity is typically O(N), as they require examining each item individually. Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup, resulting in a complexity of O(âˆšN). This means that Grover's algorithm can find the desired item in significantly fewer iterations compared to classical algorithms.
